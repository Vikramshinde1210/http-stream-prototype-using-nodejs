# HTTP Stream Prototype Using Node.js

This project demonstrates how to efficiently stream large JSON files using Node.js and Express. The server streams the `measurements.json` file via the `/measurements.json` endpoint, allowing you to handle large datasets without loading everything into memory. Clone the repo, install dependencies, add your `measurements.json`, and start the server. You can test the stream in your browser using the Developer Tools' network throttling feature.
